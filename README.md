# Local mail plugin for Moodle

This plugin allows users to send messages to each other, using an
interface and features similar to webmail clients. Messages are tied
to courses, so users can only contact other participants in courses
the user is enrolled in. Reading/sending of messages is done through a
new item in the navigation block called "My Mail".

## Developement

### Svelte

The client side components are written using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

To use the Svelte developement server you need to:

1. Set this setting in `config.php`:
   ```
   $CFG->local_mail_devserver = 'http://localhost:5173';
   ```

2. Start the developement server with:
   ```
   cd local/mail/svelte
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

To build the code for production:
```
cd local/mail/svelte
npm install
npm run build
```

The production code is stored in `local/mail/build`.

### Unit tests

See: https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/phpunit

```
php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php
php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/util.php --buildcomponentconfigs
```

Run unit tests:
